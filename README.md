# Welcome to SplitNice
Basic API for an expense sharing app
## Improvements
Some essential features if I had more time:
- SSL Encryption
- Some kind of ORM, for more robust database operations
- Validation check in controllers
- Return more useful responses (e.g. created object after POST)
- Handling bad requests (e.g. if a user with a mail doesn't exist etc.)
- Exception handling (especially sql)
